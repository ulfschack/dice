A dice rolling app using cannon and three (js)
Choose a type and its multiplicity and click "roll"

The models are made in blender, exported as .glb

Future plans: Fancy combo of types and multiplicity


(strange note to self: When carving out a number on the die faces (on _one_ of the faces on a d10), that particular face turned up more than 50% of the times. Huge over representation. I'm thinking that the mass of that part of the die decreased to such an extent that it influenced the roll by showing the lighter side up more often, cause of exagerated physics from cannon. So I think I'm gonna go with grease pencil instead)
